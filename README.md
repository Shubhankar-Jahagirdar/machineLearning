# Machine Learning Projects
- This repository details 2 Machine Learning projects Credit List prediction and Mice protien expressions predictions datasets. 
## Credit Risk Prediction
- The objective of this case study is to fit and compare 4 different binary classification models (classifiers) to predict whether a customer has good credit history or bad using the German Credit dataset. The dataset is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/statlog+(german+credit+data))
- The dataset contains 20 descriptive feature with 1 binary class feature. Out of the 20 descriptive features 7 features are numerical while 13 are categorical. All of the categorical features are represented with some coding format which is explained in the ipynb file. The class feature has two classes 'Good' which is represented as '1' and 'Bad' which is represented as '2' respectively. The whole dataset contains 1000 observation instances. The ipynb file explains all the steps taken and the algorithms used to compare and contrast the results with the hyperparameter tuning and the end results. 

## Mice Protien Expressions Predictions

- This project is based on the Mice protein expressions data set sourced from UCI repository. In this project we aim to predict the class variable using the protein information features provided in this data set. The following hyperlink is the data source : (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Mice+Protein+Expression).

- Based upon the data information provided on the source of this data set it is found that the data consists of expression levels of 77 protein modifications that produced detectable signals in the nuclear fraction of cortex of mice. There are total 72 mice out of which 38 are control and 34 are trisomic (Down Syndrome). In the experiments, 15 measurements were registered of each protein per sample/mouse. Hence we have 570 measurements for control mice and 510 measurements for trisomic mice. The data set contains 1080 measurements per protein.

- There are total 82 features in this data set including multivariate class feature which is our target feature. The class feature has 8 different target features.

- There are 77 numeric features, 4 categorical features and 1 Mouse_ID feature present in the dataset.

- Based on the provided information and collected data, the data science processes are applied and numerous algorithms are implemented, compared and results are observed which can be found in the attached ipynb python file. The conclusions and the detail information can be found in the pdf file.
